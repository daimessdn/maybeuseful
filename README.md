## simple HTML peojects for your productivity

this repository stores my "very simple" HTML apps for
productivity purposes. "very simple" means that made with
single HTML document with few CSS and JavaScript syntaxes
 which can be executed just a couple of double click of
HTML file  without Node.js or npm and any dependencies...

some of them in this repository:
- [text-format](https://daimessdn.github.io/maybeuseful/text-format.html) (saved on `pdf-format.html` in this repository  
  > re-manage PDF to get rid of "in mess" (such as new lines) text so that it can be re-formatted in one line. it is useful for academic purposes and copying-pasting text stuffs (not all PDF can be re-formatted).
- others (coming soon)
