## simple HTML peojects for your productivity

this repository stores my "very simple" HTML apps for
productivity purposes. "very simple" means that made with
single HTML document with few CSS and JavaScript syntaxes
 which can be executed just a couple of double click of
HTML file  without Node.js or npm and any dependencies...

some of them in this repository:
- [text-format](https://daimessdn.github.io/maybeuseful/text-format.html) (saved on `pdf-format.html` in this repository
- others (coming soon)
